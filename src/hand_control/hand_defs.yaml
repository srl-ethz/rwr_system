muscle_groups:
  finger1:
    joint_ids: [0, 1]           # ids for each controllable joint from proximal to distal
    tendon_ids: [0, 1, 2, 3]    # ids for each tendon according to joints, first flexor then extensor, from proximal to distal
    motor_ids: [1, 2]           # ids of motors for this muscle group
    motor_map: [1, 1, 2, 2]     # maps each tendon to a certain motor. antagonistic tendons have same motor id in motor_map
    spool_rad: [-5, 5, -5, 5]   # defines spool radius and wind direction for each tendon. 
                                # wind direction is positive, if tendon attaches on the right side of the spool (from the front of the motor)
